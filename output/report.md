Welcome to Vancouver! Get ready for an incredible 14-day, 13-night escape focused on the city's stunning beaches during its peak summer season. From sun-drenched sands to vibrant city life, this itinerary is crafted for the beach lover, blending relaxation with exploration.

**Trip Dates:** July 20, 2025 - August 2, 2025
**Traveling From:** Montreal
**Traveler Interests:** Beach
**Duration:** 14 Days / 13 Nights

Vancouver in late July/early August offers the best weather – expect warm, sunny, and dry days perfect for the beach. This period also coincides with exciting potential summer events like the Celebration of Light fireworks and Vancouver Pride festivities.

## Accommodation Suggestions

Choosing the right base is key for a beach-focused trip. Here are a few options:

1.  **Sandman Suites Vancouver on Davie** (Mid-Range)
    *   *Why:* Excellent location near English Bay beach and Davie Village, offering spacious suites with kitchenettes – great for saving money on breakfasts or casual meals. Easy walk to downtown and transit hubs.
2.  **The Burrard** (Mid-Range)
    *   *Why:* Stylish, retro-modern hotel downtown, a pleasant walk or short transit ride to English Bay and Kitsilano. Offers a cool vibe and is centrally located for exploring various neighbourhoods.
3.  **Airbnb/Vacation Rental in Kitsilano** (Various Budgets)
    *   *Why:* Staying in Kitsilano puts you right near Kits Beach and gives you a local neighbourhood feel with plenty of cafes and shops on 4th Avenue. Offers more space and potentially kitchen facilities.

*Recommendation:* For a beach focus and potential budget savings, Sandman Suites or an Airbnb in Kitsilano are excellent choices. Let's base the itinerary generally around being accessible to the English Bay/Kitsilano area.

## Estimated Budget Breakdown (CAD)

This is a high-level estimate for one person, assuming a mid-range travel style, focusing on a mix of casual and some nicer dining, and factoring in activities and transport.

*   **Flights (Montreal-Vancouver Round Trip):** $200 - $400 (Based on context estimate; book in advance!)
*   **Accommodation (13 nights):**
    *   Mid-Range Hotel (e.g., Sandman Suites): $250 - $400/night * 13 nights = $3250 - $5200
    *   *Budget Tip:* Hostels ($60-100/night) or sharing an Airbnb would significantly reduce this. Let's budget for the mid-range hotel.
*   **Food & Drink (14 days):**
    *   Mix of casual eats, picnics, and some restaurants: $80 - $150/day * 14 days = $1120 - $2100
*   **Activities & Entrance Fees:**
    *   Museums, Rentals (bike, kayak), etc.: $30 - $70/day average * 14 days = $420 - $980
*   **Local Transportation (Compass Card/Transit/Occasional Ride Share):** $10 - $20/day * 14 days = $140 - $280
*   **Buffer/Miscellaneous (Souvenirs, unexpected):** $300 - $500

**Total Estimated Budget (CAD per person):**
*   **Low End:** $200 (Flight) + $3250 (Hotel) + $1120 (Food) + $420 (Activities) + $140 (Transport) + $300 (Buffer) = **$5430**
*   **High End:** $400 (Flight) + $5200 (Hotel) + $2100 (Food) + $980 (Activities) + $280 (Transport) + $500 (Buffer) = **$9460**

*Note:* These are estimates. Booking accommodation/flights early, utilizing grocery stores for meals, focusing on free activities (beaches, parks, walking), and using public transit will help keep costs down.
